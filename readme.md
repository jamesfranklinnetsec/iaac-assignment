# Create AWS Account and deploy a:
* Hello World Java Application ([Spring Boot framework](https://start.spring.io/)) 
	- I'm using [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtPkZShrvXQ) to get my hello world going
* Running as a container
	- using [this tutorial](https://spring.io/blog/2018/11/08/spring-boot-in-a-container)
* Using a container orchestration of your choice
	- the spring boot tutorial recommends docker, so docker it is.
* Exposed via a LoadBalancer
	- I'll probably use nginx
# Bonus:
* Automated Pipelines for Deployment
* All AWS Infrastructure is deployed as script
	- probably via tf. I don't have time to go learn cloudformation just yet.
